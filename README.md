## Background
A company wants to invest a large budget in an online advertising campaign; however, the click-through rate (CTR) is still low, at only about **50%**. This low CTR indicates that most ad impressions do not capture customers' attention. Therefore, a data-driven approach using machine learning is needed to understand the characteristics of customers who are likely to click on ads. With these insights, the company can develop targeted strategies to significantly improve the CTR.

## Problems
The absence of a predictive system capable of identifying customers who are more likely to click on ads leads to suboptimal allocation of the advertising budget. This also reduces the effectiveness of campaigns, as ads are often shown to a less relevant audience. Additionally, the lack of insights into the features that influence ad clicks makes it difficult for the company to design more effective marketing strategies.

## Goals
This project aims to build a machine learning-based classification model that can predict the likelihood of customers clicking on ads based on behavioral and demographic data, such as time spent on the site, daily internet usage, and income. With this model, the company can improve the click-through rate (CTR) through more precise targeting strategies.

## Objective
1. Define the problem, goal, objectives, model, and metrics.
2. Import the necessary data and libraries.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find valuable insights.
4. Conduct data preprocessing, such as handling null values, outliers, and more.
5. Build models using various classification techniques.
6. Determine the best model based on evaluation metrics.
7. Make recommendations based on the findings from modeling and EDA.
